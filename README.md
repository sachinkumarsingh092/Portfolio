# Portfolio
You can use this portfolio to keep track of stocks bought and sold with their realtime market value.
This was inspired from CS50's finance problem set but will have additional functionality.

Flask framework is used along with mySQL for querying.

This is still in development phase with only basic functionality like registration and signing-ups implemented.
